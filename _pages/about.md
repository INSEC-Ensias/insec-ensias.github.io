INSEC is the resident computer security club at ENSIAS. We are a student-run organization which was founded to provide resources for students interested in exploring the world of computer security. At our core, we are a group of self-taught security enthusiasts who enjoy sharing our knowledge with those interested in learning. We believe in the freedom of information, and do our best to prepare resources, organize meetings, and host educational events on our own time.
